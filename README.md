# Strudel Sounds

A collection of experimental electronic music compositions created with [Strudel](https://strudel.cc/), a live coding environment for algorithmic music.

## About

This repository contains three unique musical pieces, each exploring different emotional and sonic territories through algorithmic composition. All pieces are designed to be copied and pasted directly into the Strudel live coding environment at [strudel.cc](https://strudel.cc/).

## Compositions

### üéµ Harmony.js
**Theme:** Balance and Unity  
**Tempo:** 0.6 BPM  
**Mood:** Peaceful, flowing, connected

A composition that represents balance and unity through:
- Peaceful bass progression with sawtooth waves
- Flowing melody using music box sounds
- Interwoven harmonic voices with acoustic guitar
- Gentle rhythmic pulse and soft textures
- Ambient pads creating space and depth
- Bell-like accents for moments of clarity

### üîç Searching.js
**Theme:** Exploration of the Unknown  
**Tempo:** 0.5 BPM  
**Mood:** Enigmatic, mysterious, uncertain

A piece that explores the unknown through:
- Enigmatic bass with chromatic chord progressions
- Whispered melodies with blown bottle sounds
- Shadowy arpeggios with glitchy textures
- Sparse percussion mimicking footsteps in fog
- Reversed whispers and metallic bells
- Deep rumbling sub-bass creating tension

### ‚ö° Tension.js
**Theme:** Dark, Groovy, and Sinister  
**Tempo:** 0.5 BPM  
**Mood:** Dark, groovy, sinister

A composition that builds tension through:
- Groovy but heavy kick patterns
- Syncopated snare rhythms
- Dark chord progressions with chromatic movement
- Sinister melodies rising chromatically
- Tritone bass lines creating harmonic tension
- Atmospheric pads and cinematic effects

## How to Use

1. Visit [strudel.cc](https://strudel.cc/)
2. Copy any of the composition code from the files in this repository
3. Paste the code into the Strudel editor
4. Press play to hear the composition
5. Experiment with modifying parameters to create variations

## Technical Details

All compositions use:
- **Strudel syntax** for live coding
- **Stack-based layering** for complex arrangements
- **Real-time parameter modulation** using sine waves and random functions
- **Spatial audio effects** including reverb, delay, and panning
- **Dynamic filtering** and envelope shaping
- **Sample-based synthesis** with various sound sources

## Author

All compositions by **Donnie Vedder**
